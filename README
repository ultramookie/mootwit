mootwit

my reinventing another wheel for the sake of learning python.

create a mysql database.

use the schema file (mootwit.sql) to create the base table.

IMPORTANT for BOTH new users and old twitter-only users who
want to use google+/app.net imports too:

alter the base tables using moogooplusalters.sql.

alter the base tables using mooappnetalters.sql.

*** Twitter ***

edit mooGet.py script and put in all the right stuff:
  - db information (self-explanatory in script)
  - twitter username that you want to backup
  - twitter related oath information that you can get
    by registering an app at dev.twitter.com

if that's all you want, then cron the mooGet.py script
to run every so often to grab any new tweets.

*** Google+ ***

edit moogooplusget.py script and put in all the right stuff:
  - db information (self-explanatory in script)
  - google+ userid (details in script)
  - google api key (details in script)
  - etc

if that's all you want, then cron the moogooplusget.py script
to run every so often to grab any new posts.

note: moogooplusget.py only gets public posts (limitation of the
google+ api currently). also, the script only fetches posts,
shares and location check-ins are ignored.

*** App.net ***

pre-requisites: 
  - feedparser (http://pythonhosted.org/feedparser/)
  - BeautifulSoup (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

edit mooappnetget.py script and put in all the right stuff:
  - db information (self-explanatory in script)
  - rss url for the user you wish to back up 

if that's all you want, then cron the mooappnetget.py script
to run every so often to grab any new posts.

note: mooappnetget.py reads posts from an rss feed for a user,
that means that only public posts are backed up.

*** Front-End ***

if you want a web front-end to display what you're backing
up, use the files in "webui" to do that.

you'll need to have mod_rewrite enabled for the webui to 
work.

copy "config-example.php" over to "config.php". then edit:
  - db information

edit the top of "mootwit.php" to customize to your liking:
  - site name
  - site url
  - number of entries to display per page
  - etc

no warranties. no guarantees. have fun and don't blame me
if something explodes.

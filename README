mootwit

my reinventing another wheel for the sake of learning python.

create a mysql database.

use the schema file (mootwit.sql) to create the base table.

edit the mooGet.py script and put in all the right stuff:
  - db information
  - twitter account to backup
  - etc

note: the account must be public for this to work.

if that's all you want, then cron the mooGet.py script to
run every so often to grab any new tweets.

if you want a web front-end to display what you're backing
up, use the files in "webui" to do that.

copy "config-example.php" over to "config.php". then edit:
  - db information

edit the top of "mootwit.php" to customize to your liking:
  - site name
  - site url
  - number of entries to display per page
  - etc

no warranties. no guarantees. have fun and don't blame me
if something explodes.

mootwit

my reinventing another wheel for the sake of learning python.

create a mysql database.

use the schema file (mootwit.sql) to create the base table.

IMPORTANT for BOTH new users and old twitter-only users who
want to use google+ imports too:

alter the base tables using moogooplusalters.sql.

For Twitter only, and only for a limited time as Twitter
has changed their API rules and regulations. More info here:
https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api

edit the mooGet.py script and put in all the right stuff:
  - db information
  - twitter account to backup
  - etc

note: the account must be public for this to work.

if that's all you want, then cron the mooGet.py script to
run every so often to grab any new tweets. remember, Twitter
stuff will stop functioning soon when the API rule changes
take effect.

For Google+:

edit moogooplusget.py script and put in all the right stuff:
  - db information
  - google+ userid (details in script)
  - google api key (details in script)
  - etc

if that's all you want, then cron the moogooplusget.py script
to run every so often to grab any new posts.

note: moogooplusget.py only gets public posts (limitation of the
google+ api currently). also, the script only fetches posts,
shares and location check-ins are ignored.

if you want a web front-end to display what you're backing
up, use the files in "webui" to do that.

you'll need to have mod_rewrite enabled for the webui to 
work.

copy "config-example.php" over to "config.php". then edit:
  - db information

edit the top of "mootwit.php" to customize to your liking:
  - site name
  - site url
  - number of entries to display per page
  - etc

no warranties. no guarantees. have fun and don't blame me
if something explodes.
